//! This module contains the public API of the delivery service (DS) module.
//! While the DS also contains some rate-limiting functionality, it should only
//! be used behind a rate-limiting module.
//!
//! NOTE: This document and the API stubs in this module represent a work in
//! progress and will likely change in their details. However, barring the
//! discovery of a major flaw in the current design, the general design of the
//! DS should remain the same.
//!
//! TODO: Write this with a low-metadata flag in mind that changes if missing
//! links and EID information are stored encrypted and separately.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! The main task of the delivery service is to distribute messages sent by
//! clients in the context of an MLS group to the members of said group
//! represented by each member's queueing service.
//!
//! To do this robustly, prevent the accumulation of metadata associated with
//! individual users and their devices and to prevent group-level
//! denial-of-service attacks, the delivery service has to keep some additional
//! state and perform a few checks with each message received.
//!
//! The DS also performs the secondary task of keeping track of the state of a
//! given group well enough to provide joiners with enough information to join
//! the group via an external commit.
//!
//! # Encryption at rest (EAR)
//!
//! The metadata that the DS has to store to fulfill its functionality is
//! encrypted at rest using keys which the clients provide when querying an API
//! endpoint of the DS.
//!
//! The EAR key is ratcheted forward and injected with a fresh secret with every
//! commit. The fresh secret is provided by the committer in the AAD of its
//! query such that the server and all other group members can compute the new
//! key.
//!
//! TODO: Add note about key-committing encryption scheme.
//!
//! # State expiration
//!
//! TODO: Explain how each state has a time-stamp that is updated whenever the
//! state is accessed. Also clean-up of pieces of state that have not been used
//! for a certain period of time.
//!
//! # Group State
//!
//! The delivery service requires clients to communicate using MLS plaintexts
//! for a number of reasons.
//!
//! * To perform validity checks on incoming messages (especially commits)
//! * To be able to provide a GroupInfo object to joiners that want to join via
//!   an external commit without requiring committers to send a full GroupInfo
//!   every time
//! * To authenticate messages by the individual group members via the signature
//!   key in the key package of the respective member
//!
//! ## Pseudonymous LeafNodes
//!
//! To avoid having to store the identity of individual group members, group
//! members can use pseudonymous LeafNodes. A Pseudonymous LeafNodes does not
//! contain a Credential with the client's real Client- and UserID, but instead
//! contains a pseudonymous (random) Client- and UserID. Since the DS should be
//! able to enforce group policies and thus needs to know which clients belong
//! to which user (at least in the context of an individual group), the
//! pseudonymous UserID needs to be the same for all clients of a given user in
//! a given group.
//!
//! ## Missing link certificate chains
//!
//! Group members (and especially newly joining group members) still need to be
//! able to authenticate all other members of a given group. This is achieved by
//! the DS keeping an encrypted "missing link certificate chains" for each group
//! member, which contains the key with which the pseudonymous credential is
//! signed and which is in turn signed by the client's (intermediate) client
//! key.
//!
//! The encrypted missing link certificate chains need to be stored by the DS
//! twice, each time encrypted under a different symmetric key with overlapping
//! validity periods. This is to allow key rotations in the asynchronous
//! setting.
//!
//! When an old key expires, the next committer uploads new ciphertexts
//! encrypted under a group key derived from the key schedule of the old epoch.
//!
//! Whenever a new member joins the group, the adding group member needs to
//! include the decryption key in the Welcome, so that new group members can
//! authenticate existing ones.
//!
//! ## Evolving identity state
//!
//! To fully authenticate existing group members, new group members need the
//! Evolving Identity state of the existing group members.
//!
//! Thus, in addition to the encrypted missing link credential, the DS stores
//! the evolving identity state of each group member encrypted using the same
//! key rotation scheme, such that new group members can fully authenticate
//!
//! ## Queue information
//!
//! When receiving a message from a client, the DS main functionality is the
//! delivery of the message to its recipients. It thus needs to store a QueueID
//! for each member of each group.
//!
//! To this end, the DS keeps an additional record for each LeafNode, which
//! contains the QueueID that the corresponding member wishes to use for this
//! group, along with other information such as an authentication key that the
//! DS can use to prove to the queuing service (QS) that it is authorized to
//! enqueue messages in this particular queue.
//!
//! For new members that are added via a Welcome, the QueueID and corresponding
//! information needs to be present in the KeyPackage encrypted asymmetrically
//! under the private key the DS uses for this purpose.
//!
//! TODO: This is problematic, as the QueueID and other information is not
//! encrypted at rest here. Since it's (intended to be) temporary, maybe this is
//! not a problem?
//!
//! TODO: We should explain the generation of QueueIDs and temporary QueueIDs in
//! another place that we can link to here.
//!
//! # Welcome message delivery
//!
//! The DS does not provide an API endpoint for Welcome message delivery.
//! Instead, clients that invite new group members should send the messages via
//! their connection group.
//!
//! TODO: Add link to an explanation of a connection group.
//!
//! # Pseudonym-based rate-limiting
//!
//! TODO: Explain pseudonym-based rate limiting
//!
//! # Metadata on the DS
//!
//! TODO: Discuss here what the data in the group state actually reveals about
//! the individual members.
//!
//! # Message format
//!
//! TODO: Discuss message format here or point to a discussion of what the
//! message format looks like.
